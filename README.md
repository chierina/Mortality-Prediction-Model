# Heath Risk Prediction for SCOR Datathon
I participated in SCOR Datathon from October 2019 to March 2020 with studetns from Polytecnique(X).\
SCOR is the tier 1 reinsurance company in the world.\
During this 6 months, we were to predict the health risks in U.S. using [NHANES](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm) and [NHCS](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhcs/data_uses.htm) open data to create a health risk detection product.
