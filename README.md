# Mortality Prediction Model for SCOR Datathon
I participated in SCOR Datathon from October 2019 to March 2020 with studetns from Polytecnique(X).\
SCOR is the tier 1 reinsurance company in the world.\
During this 6 months, we were to predict the mortality in U.S. using NHANES and NCHS open data and then calculate the Biological Age.\
In this folder you can find the codes to retreive, clean, and impute, data and as well as the model to predict the mortality.
